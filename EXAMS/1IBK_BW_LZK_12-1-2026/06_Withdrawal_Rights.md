## General Rule

⚡ **EXAM TIP:** This is the most important rule!

💡 **KEY POINT:** Once a valid contract is concluded, there is generally **NO GOING BACK!** Both parties must fulfill their obligations.

---

## Methods of Contract Dissolution

### 1. Mutual Agreement (Einvernehmliche Auflösung)

Seller and buyer agree to reverse the contract.

### 2. Exchange (Umtausch)

Return product, select another.

💡 **KEY POINT:** There is **NO LEGAL RIGHT** to exchange! Must be individually agreed. Seller may only offer a credit note.

⚡ **EXAM TIP:** In practice, exchange rights are often written on the invoice or in the contract.

---

### 3. Withdrawal (Rücktritt)

Buyer's withdrawal is ONLY possible if:

| Condition | German |
|-----------|--------|
| Explicitly agreed in contract | Im Vertrag vereinbart |
| Contract concluded illegally | Rechtswidrig zustande gekommen |
| Fraudulent misrepresentation | Arglistige Täuschung |
| Seller's delay in performance | Verzug der Erfüllung |

> **DEFINITION:** **Arglistig** = Knowingly malicious (e.g., seller deliberately concealed a defect)

---

### 4. Cancellation (Stornierung)

> **DEFINITION:** **Stornieren** = To reverse a contract

💡 **KEY POINT:** Cancellation is possible but usually requires a **cancellation fee (Stornogebühr)**. Check the AGB!

---

## Special Withdrawal Rights

⚡ **EXAM TIP:** These apply to specific situations only!

### When Do Special Rights Apply?

**Outside business premises:**
- Door-to-door sales (Haustürgeschäft)
- Promotional trips (Werbefahrten)

**Distance selling:**
- Online shops
- Phone orders
- Catalog orders

💡 **KEY POINT:** Buyer can withdraw **without giving reasons** and **without paying cancellation fee**.

---

### Withdrawal Periods

| Seller's Action | Buyer's Withdrawal Period |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Seller INFORMS about right | **14 calendar days** after contract or delivery |
| Seller does NOT inform | **1 year + 14 days** |

**Example:** Jacket ordered online, delivered August 7th → Can withdraw until August 21st.

---

### After Withdrawal

- Buyer pays return costs (if seller informed about this)
- If product was used/consumed, seller may demand compensation
- Seller must refund money received

---
