## 5 Statutory Components

⚡ **EXAM TIP:** These are the MINIMUM requirements for a valid contract!

| # | English | German |
|---|---------|--------|

| 2 | Specific Buyer | Bestimmter Käufer |
| 3 | Quality (Product Type) | Qualität |
| 4 | Quantity | Menge |
| 5 | Price | Preis |

## Fungible vs Non-Fungible Goods

💡 **KEY POINT:** The type of goods determines which quality definition method to use!

### Fungible Products (Vertretbare Produkte)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Meaning | Interchangeable; quality evident from one piece |
| Quality Methods | Samples, brands, types, standards |
| Examples | Mobile phones, new cars, clothing, DIN A4 paper |

### Non-Fungible Products (Nicht vertretbare Produkte)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Meaning | Individually made; each piece unique |
| Quality Methods | Inspection, description, illustration |
| Examples | Art, real estate, used cars, custom furniture |

## Methods of Quality Definition

### 1. Inspection (Besichtigung)

- Buyer examines product directly
- Important for unique items, used goods, products with defects
- Contract phrase: "Wie besichtigt" (as inspected)

### 2. Description & Illustration (Beschreibung und Abbildung)

- Text and images explain characteristics
- Common in online shops

### 3. Samples & Specimens (Muster und Proben)

> **DEFINITION:** **Muster** = Small quantities showing quality of the whole
> **DEFINITION:** **Proben** = Free samples for consumption/testing

| Type | German | Description | Return Right |
|------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Purchase by Sample | Kauf nach Probe/Muster | Product must match sample | If doesn't match |
| Purchase on Approval | Kauf auf Probe | Return within set period | Yes |
| Purchase for Testing | Kauf zur Probe | Small quantity to test | No |

### 4. Brands & Types (Marken und Typen)

> **DEFINITION:** **Marken** = Protected signs distinguishing products from competitors

**Types of Marks:**
- Word marks (Coca-Cola)
- Pictorial marks (Apple logo)
- Combined marks (BMW logo)

💡 **KEY POINT:** The Trademark Protection Act (Markenschutzgesetz) protects brands.

> **DEFINITION:** **Typen** = Similar products from one company (iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro)

### 5. Standards (Normen)

> **DEFINITION:** Guidelines for standardizing products (size, shape, materials)

**Examples:**
- ÖNORM A 1650 — School chairs and tables
- DIN A4 — Standard paper format

⚡ **EXAM TIP:** Most standards are NOT legally binding — must be explicitly agreed in contract!

### 6. Quality Classes (Qualitätsklassen/Handelsklassen)

Products classified by criteria. Mainly for food products.

**Example:** Apples classified as Extra, 1, 2, or 3

### 7. Quality Labels (Gütezeichen/Gütesiegel)

Markings indicating product quality. Often awarded by associations/NGOs.

**Example:** AMA-Gütesiegel — Guarantees quality and Austrian origin

---

## Special Purchase Types

### Spezifikationskauf (Purchase by Specification)

> **DEFINITION:** Quality roughly defined; buyer specifies details (quantity, dimensions) within a deadline.

**Example:** Fashion store orders 1000 jeans, sizes specified, but color to be determined by March 1st.

### Kauf in Bausch und Bogen (Purchase in Bulk)

> **DEFINITION:** Buyer takes entire goods at one price regardless of defects. Seller not liable for specific quality.

💡 **KEY POINT:** Goods must not be unusable or only consist of worst quality.

**Example:** Sale of entire grape harvest in bulk.
