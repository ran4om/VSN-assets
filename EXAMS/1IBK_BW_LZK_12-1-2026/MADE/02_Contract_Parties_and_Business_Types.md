## What is a Contract?

> **DEFINITION:** **Contracts (Verträge)** are agreements about a specific transaction between two or more contracting parties. They are associated with legal consequences and must be carefully considered.

### English
Depending on the composition of the contracting parties, three types of business transactions are distinguished.

### Deutsch
Je nach Zusammensetzung der beteiligten Vertragspartner unterscheidet man drei Geschäftsarten.

## Three Business Types

⚡ **EXAM TIP:** Know the abbreviations and which laws apply!

### C2C — Consumer-to-Consumer

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Parties | Private person ↔ Private person |
| Characteristics | Limited legal protection; warranties often excluded |
| Example | Sam sells old phone to Dani via eBay/Willhaben |

💡 **KEY POINT:** Very little legal protection in C2C transactions. "Gekauft wie gesehen" (bought as seen) often applies.

### B2C — Business-to-Consumer

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Parties | Company → Private person |
| Characteristics | Strong consumer protection (KSchG, FAGG) |
| Examples | Supermarket sales, online shops, bakery purchases |

💡 **KEY POINT:** This is where consumer protection laws apply most strongly!

---

### B2B — Business-to-Business

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Parties | Company ↔ Company |
| Characteristics | Less consumer protection; governed by UGB |
| Examples | Billa buys from Schärdinger; wholesaler to retailer |

💡 **KEY POINT:** Businesses are assumed to have more knowledge, so less protection.
